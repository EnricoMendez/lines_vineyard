# lines_vineyard
ROS package for research of crop row detection in vineyards. Worked in ROS Noetic

## Installation
Go to the src directory in your ROS workspace. Change "catkin_ws" on the command to the name of your workspace.

$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src

Copy this respository in the src directory. 

$ git https://github.com/EnricoMendez/lines_vineyard.git

Compile the workspace using catkin_make.

$ cd ..
$ catkin_make

## Run the code
### Setup
There are three ways to use the code. Using simulation, connect to a physical platform, and using a rosbag to simulate one of the test made by the owners of thies repository.

#### Simulation

Download the simulation using the guide in the section of "Software used" subsection "Simulation" of this README.

Once you have the simulation running in Gazebo, add two boxes and make them into two large walls to the side of the Jackal. As shown in the nect image:

#### Physical platform

#### Rosbag test

# Software used

This package was run using the following software
-Linux Ubunt 20.04 (Install here:)
-Ros Noetic (Install here: )

## Opencv

Opencv version 4.6.0.66 is used in this pacakge. 
To install use: pip install opencv-python
Open cv documentation can be found here: https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/index.html


## WEBCAM
Model: Logitech C525

Installation:

First install the v4l-util Ubuntu package. It is a collection of command-line V4L utilities used by the usb_cam package: 

$ sudo apt-get install v4l-utils 

Then install the ROS usb_cam package: 

$ sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-usb-camâ€¯ 

To verify the PC recognize the camera:

$ dmesg

To connect the camera with the ROS initialize a roscore and execute:

$ rosrun usb_cam usb_cam_node _video_device:=/dev/video0 _pixel_format:=yuyv  

Parameter "/dev/video0" can change depending on where is the device detected. (/dev/video2 worked for us)

If the error "Unable to locate package ros-noetic-usb-cam" appear, clone the package to your workspace/src:

$ git clone https://github.com/bosch-ros-pkg/usb_cam.git

Finally, to visualize the video run:

$ rosrun image_view image_view image:=/usb_cam/image_raw 

## Simulation

Download the ROS worlds from clearpath: cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/cpr_gazebo.git

To launch the world we used for testing run: 

roslaunch cpr_agriculture_gazebo agriculture_world.launch platform:=jackal
